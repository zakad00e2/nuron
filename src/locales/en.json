                    "description": "An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset verified using blockchain technology. Unlike cryptocurrencies, each NFT is one-of-a-kind and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis. NFTs can represent digital art, collectibles, music, videos, and more, providing proof of ownership and authenticity."

Click 'Create' to upload your digital file (image, video, audio, etc.), add details like name and description, then choose your blockchain and mint your NFT. Once minted, you can list it for sale with a fixed price or auction format."

                    "description": "Gas fees are transaction costs required to process operations on the blockchain network. These fees go to network validators and vary based on network congestion and transaction complexity. Gas fees are required for minting, buying, and selling NFTs. We recommend checking current gas prices before transactions."

                    "title": "How do royalties work?",
                    "description": "Creators can set royalty percentages (typically 5-10%) when minting NFTs. This means you'll automatically receive a percentage of sales each time your NFT is resold on secondary markets. Royalties are built into the smart contract and are automatically distributed to your wallet."
                },
                {
                    "title": "Is my NFT secure?",
                    "description": "Yes, NFTs are secured by blockchain technology, making them highly secure and tamper-proof. Each NFT has a unique identifier and transaction history stored permanently on the blockchain. However, it's crucial to keep your wallet's private keys and seed phrases secure, as losing them means losing access to your NFTs."
